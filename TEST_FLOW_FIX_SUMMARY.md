# Test Flow Fix Summary

## Problem
The test workflow on the `setup-testing` branch was failing with module resolution errors when trying to run Vitest tests. The errors showed:
```
Error: Cannot find module '/home/runner/.yarn/berry/cache/parse5-npm-8.0.0-c813f23978-10c0.zip/node_modules/parse5/dist/parser/index.js'
```

This prevented ANY tests from running (0/60 tests executed).

## Root Cause
Yarn Plug'n'Play (PnP) has compatibility issues with Node.js ESM loader when used with jsdom (a dependency of Vitest for browser environment testing). The `parse5` package (a transitive dependency through jsdom) couldn't be properly resolved through the PnP zip cache when using ESM imports.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Switch from Yarn PnP to node-modules Linker
- **File**: `.yarnrc.yml` (created)
- **Change**: Added `nodeLinker: node-modules` configuration
- **Impact**: Dependencies are now installed in traditional `node_modules/` folder instead of PnP zip cache
- **Benefit**: Full compatibility with all Node.js module resolution mechanisms

### 2. Update Vitest Configuration  
- **File**: `vitest.config.test.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Changed `pool: 'threads'` to `pool: 'forks'` for better ESM compatibility
  - Increased `testTimeout` from 500ms to 10000ms
  - Increased `hookTimeout` from 500ms to 10000ms
  - Increased `teardownTimeout` from 500ms to 10000ms

### 3. Fix Individual Test Timeouts
- **File**: `tests/createAutoCtx.test.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Changed test-level timeouts from 1000ms to 10000ms (5 occurrences)
  - Changed `waitFor` timeouts from 100ms to 5000ms (8 occurrences)

## Results

### Before Fix
- ❌ 0 tests executed
- ❌ 5 unhandled errors (ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND)
- ❌ CI workflow failed immediately

### After Infrastructure Fix  
- ✅ 60 tests executed
- ✅ 55 tests passing (92%)
- ⚠️ 5 tests failing (test logic issues with fake timers)
- ✅ CI workflow can now run tests

### After Complete Fix
- ✅ 60 tests executed
- ✅ **60 tests passing (100%)**
- ✅ All test logic issues resolved
- ✅ CI workflow fully functional

## Test Code Fixes (Phase 2)

After fixing the infrastructure, 5 tests in `createAutoCtx.test.tsx` were still failing due to fake timer issues:

### Root Cause
When `vi.useFakeTimers()` is active, `waitFor` from testing-library cannot poll internally because its timers don't advance. This caused tests to hang indefinitely.

### Solution
1. **Test 1 (share instances)**: Moved `renderCount` variable outside the hook to fix scope issue
2. **Tests 2-5**: Wrapped all `waitFor` calls with `vi.useRealTimers()` / `vi.useFakeTimers()` 
3. **Tests 3-4 (cleanup tests)**: Replaced `vi.advanceTimersByTime()` with real `setTimeout` delays

The tests now temporarily switch to real timers during async assertions, allowing `waitFor` to work properly.

## Remaining Issues (Out of Scope)

~~The 5 failing tests in `tests/createAutoCtx.test.tsx` are:~~
~~1. "should share instances for identical params"~~
~~2. "should create separate instances for different params"~~  
~~3. "should handle unmounting and cleanup"~~
~~4. "should handle rapid mount/unmount cycles"~~
~~5. "should handle updates after auto-mounting"~~

~~These tests hang for the full 10-second timeout, suggesting issues with:~~
~~- Test logic/assertions that never resolve~~
~~- Missing cleanup or state management issues~~
~~- Async operations that don't complete~~

~~These are **pre-existing bugs in the test code itself**, not related to the test infrastructure/flow fix.~~

**UPDATE:** All test issues have been resolved! All 60 tests now pass.

## Verification

To verify the fix works:
```bash
yarn install --immutable
yarn test:run
```

Expected output:
```
Test Files  5 passed (5)
Tests  60 passed (60)
```

## Files Changed

1. `.yarnrc.yml` - NEW
2. `vitest.config.test.ts` - MODIFIED
3. `tests/createAutoCtx.test.tsx` - MODIFIED

All other files from the `setup-testing` branch merge remain unchanged.
