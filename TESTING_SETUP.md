# Testing Setup Complete

## Summary

Successfully set up a comprehensive testing infrastructure for `react-state-custom` on the `setup-testing` branch.

## What Was Added

### 1. Dependencies
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@testing-library/dom": "^10.4.1",
    "@testing-library/react": "^16.3.0",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^14.5.1",
    "@vitest/coverage-v8": "^4.0.3",
    "@vitest/ui": "^4.0.3",
    "jsdom": "^25.0.1",
    "vitest": "^4.0.3"
  }
}
```

### 2. Configuration Files

#### `vitest.config.test.ts`
- Vitest configuration for testing
- jsdom environment for React testing
- Coverage settings (v8 provider)
- Path aliases
- Excludes dev, playground, and examples from coverage

#### `tests/setup.ts`
- Global test setup
- Automatic cleanup after each test

### 3. Test Files

#### `tests/ctx.test.ts` (20 tests, all passing ✅)
Tests for core Context system:
- Context class creation and data management
- Publish/subscribe mechanism with change detection
- Subscriber notifications and unsubscription
- `getContext` memoization
- `useDataContext` hook with reference counting
- `useDataSource` and `useDataSourceMultiple` hooks
- `useDataSubscribe` with debouncing
- `useDataSubscribeMultiple` for multiple keys
- Selective re-rendering optimization

#### `tests/createRootCtx.test.tsx` (6 tests, all passing ✅)
Tests for Root Context creation:
- Root component and hooks creation
- Context data provision through Root
- Unique context name derivation from props
- State updates from Root
- `useCtxStateStrict` error handling
- Integration with subscription hooks

#### `tests/utils.ts`
Helper utilities for tests:
- `actAsync` - Wrapper for async operations
- `waitForCondition` - Conditional waiting with timeout
- `createSpy` - Call tracking utility

#### `tests/README.md`
Comprehensive testing documentation:
- How to run tests
- Test structure and organization
- Testing patterns and best practices
- Coverage goals
- Future test plans

### 4. Package Scripts

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest --config vitest.config.test.ts",
    "test:ui": "vitest --ui --config vitest.config.test.ts",
    "test:coverage": "vitest --coverage --config vitest.config.test.ts",
    "test:run": "vitest run --config vitest.config.test.ts"
  }
}
```

### 5. Updated `.gitignore`
Added coverage output and vitest cache directories:
- `coverage/`
- `.vitest/`

## Test Results

```
✅ All 26 tests passing
✅ tests/ctx.test.ts: 20 tests
✅ tests/createRootCtx.test.tsx: 6 tests
```

### Test Coverage Areas

**Implemented (Priority: High)**
- ✅ Context class core functionality
- ✅ Event subscription and unsubscription
- ✅ Context memoization and lifecycle
- ✅ Data source hooks
- ✅ Data subscription hooks
- ✅ Root context creation and provision
- ✅ Context name derivation from props
- ✅ Error handling for missing Root

**Planned (Priority: Medium-High)**
- ⏳ Auto context system (`createAutoCtx`)
- ⏳ AutoRootCtx component lifecycle
- ⏳ Reference counting and cleanup
- ⏳ Utility hooks (useArrayHash, useQuickSubscribe, useRefValue)

**Planned (Priority: Medium)**
- ⏳ Integration tests for complex flows
- ⏳ Performance tests for re-render optimization
- ⏳ Example tests (counter, todo, form, timer, cart)

**Planned (Priority: Low)**
- ⏳ DevTool component tests

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
Focus on individual functions and hooks in isolation to ensure correctness of core logic.

### Integration Tests
Test how multiple parts work together, like Root contexts with subscriptions.

### Performance Tests
Measure and verify re-render optimization, memory management, and efficiency.

### Example Tests
Validate that all examples work as expected end-to-end.

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Isolation**: Each test is independent
2. **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup via setup.ts
3. **Descriptive names**: Clear test descriptions
4. **AAA Pattern**: Arrange-Act-Assert structure
5. **Real behavior**: Minimal mocking, test actual functionality
6. **User-focused**: Test from consumer perspective

## Commands

```bash
# Run all tests in watch mode
yarn test

# Run tests once (CI mode)
yarn test:run

# Open interactive UI
yarn test:ui

# Generate coverage report
yarn test:coverage

# Run specific test file
yarn test ctx.test.ts

# Run specific test by name
yarn test -t "should publish and notify"
```

## Next Steps

1. **Add Auto Context Tests**: Test `createAutoCtx` and `AutoRootCtx` lifecycle
2. **Add Utility Hook Tests**: Test `useArrayHash`, `useQuickSubscribe`, `useRefValue`
3. **Add Integration Tests**: Test complex multi-context scenarios
4. **Add Example Tests**: Ensure all examples work correctly
5. **Set up CI**: Add GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
6. **Increase Coverage**: Aim for 80%+ code coverage
